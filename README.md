You do not need to install anything to be able to run this project. 


All you have to do is: 

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the "index.html" file in the "Web Application" folder.
3. Run this .html file in Chrome.
4. Now you are ready to use the WDT Receptionist system.

You can check in and check out staff members.
You can also create new deliveries. They can be either delivered with Car or Motorcycle. 
You will be notified if one of the staff members or the delivery drivers are running late.


Enjoy!
